# TideMap

This script needs JSXGetURL and CreativeDeveloperTools_ES. These folders are not committed to the repo - they need
to be installed manually.

CRDT_ES is in a publicly accessible repo:

https://github.com/zwettemaan/CRDT_ES

JSXGetURL can be downloaded from

https://www.rorohiko.com/wordpress/jsxgeturl/

Also, an embedded JSXGetURL license is needed. This is contained in a separate small .jsx file which is also not
committed to the repo.
